#Base de Dados

This repository is result of the work acomplished on the course of Data Bases.
The project consists of a mySQL DB, that talks to an ugly php API.
The DB stores information about the users notebook: the pages, the articles, the tipes of articles.
The tricky part was implementing an history feature where the user was able to undo the modifications made since the creation
of the notebook.

### Post work Completion objectives
[@johnytiago](https://github.com/johnytiago) - "Personaly I never really enjoyed coding in php, for my experience it too much
of a spaghetti code. My plan is to implement the SPA pattern here, having a Node.js API to speak with the DB and a React.js
pretty interface to talk to the API. This would be a great way to apply the already acquired knowledge in these tecnologies!"

- [ ] Node.JS API
- [ ] Migration to React.JS Front-end
